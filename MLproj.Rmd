#Preparing Data
```
setwd("C:/Users/Neil/SkyDrive/DataScience/MachineLearning")

#### Reading in data ####
trainurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
dest.training <- "data.training.csv"
testurl <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
dest.testing <- "data.testing.csv"
download.file(trainurl,dest.training); download.file(testurl,dest.testing)

data <- read.csv("data.training.csv", na.strings = c("NA", ""))
#### ####
```

Now that the data is loaded in, we split the data into training and test sets.
```
library(caret)

set.seed(0)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = data$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
training <- data[inTrain, ]
testing <- data[-inTrain, ]
```

Looking at the dataset, there are a plethora of variables with nearly zero variance and missing values. Additionally, some variables are not useful for prediction, so we remove those.

```
## Manage variables with near zero variance
nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
training <- training[, -nzv]
testing <- testing[, -nzv]

#remove variables with substantial amounts of missing values
NAcols <- sapply(training, function(x) mean(is.na(x))) > 0.7
training <- training[,NAcols==FALSE]
testing <- testing[,NAcols == FALSE]

#remove the first five columns
training <- training[,-c(1:5)]
testing <- testing[,-c(1:5)]
```

#Random Forest Model
The first model we attempt to build will be a Random Forest. 

```
fitRF <- train(classe~., data = training, method = "rf")
```


```
predRF <- predict(fitRF, newdata = testing)
confusionMatrix(testing$classe, predRF)
```

We get an accuracy of about 99.8%, so the expected out-of-sample error is 0.2%. 
This algorithm is accurate enough for this dataset, so we will forgo training other models.

##Predicting on Test Set

We now fit our model on the given test set and use the given file submission code. 
```
data.testing <- read.csv("data.testing.csv")
predRF.testing <- as.character(predict(fitRF, newdata = data.testing))

pml_write_files = function(x){
    n = length(x)
    for(i in 1:n){
        filename = paste0("problem_id_",i,".txt")
        write.table(x[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
    }
}

setwd("C:/Users/Neil/SkyDrive/DataScience/MachineLearning/submitFiles")

pml_write_files(predRF.testing)
```
